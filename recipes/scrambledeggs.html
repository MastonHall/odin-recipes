        <p>A recipe for simple, yummy scrambled eggs!</p>

        <h2>What we will need</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>3 Large Eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Milk</li>
            <li>Extra-virgin Olive Oil for the pan</li>
            <li>Sea salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
            <li>Chopped fresh chives, optional, for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps to make</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Crack the eggs into a medium bowl and add the milk. Whisk until smooth and combined, with no steaks of egg white remaining</li>
            <li>Brush a small nonstick skilled with olive oil, or melt a little butter in a nonstick skillet. Bring to medium heat.</li>
            <li>Pour in the eggs, and let them cook for a few seconds without stirring. Pull a rubber spatula across the bottom of the pan
            to form large, soft curds of scrambled eggs.</li>
            <li>Continue cooking over medium-low heat, folding and stirring the eggs every few seconds. Scrape the spatula along the bottom
            and sides of the pan often to form more curds and to prevent any part of the eggs from drying out.</li>
            <li>Remove the pan from the heat when the eggs are mostly set, but a little liquid egg remains. Season to taste with salt and pepper
            and garnish with chopped fresh chives, if desired.</li>
            
        </ol>
